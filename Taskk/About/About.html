	<p>TAcademic conferences play a key role in exchanging 
research ideas between participants and keeping 
researchers current. Many academic conferences, in 
various fields, are held annually. This leads to a dramatic 
increase in the number of submitted papers, and 
substantial effort to manage these many submissions. 
Such an intricate workflow of conference management 
results in frustration among many conference organizers. 
In this paper, we propose an online system to support the

	  RE deals with making decisions on what needs to be 
done and when should it be done, the constraints that 
need to be satisfied, whatinformation the proposed 
system should provide, and the tools used to achieve the 
goal [6], [13] and [16]. It should be obvious that 
requirement engineering is the most important 
sub-process. The outcomes of requirement engineering 
are tightly interconnected,  and they direct all the 
subsequent subprocesses of the software development 
process. A number of software projects have failed due 
to unclear, ambiguous, inconsistent, and incomplete 
requirements [6], and [19]. Requirements are listed in 
natural languages to facilitate understanding them, and 
various models are used to assist in their analysis. 
Software engineers and researchers argue that such a 
combination of the list of requirements and the models 
used is a superior approach to improve the quality of the 
requirement engineering process. Modeling techniques 
are usually communicative, accurate, and promote the 
development teamâ€™s specifications and grasping of the 
requirements. Lists of requirements expressed in natural 
language represent an agreement between customers and 
developers, and they abridge requirements management 
[1], [6], and [14].
